\section{Conclusion and Discussion}
We give a one pass algorithm that samples rows coming in an online manner and maintains a coreset which preserves properties essential for tensor factorization. The sampling complexity and space required for the algorithm is sublinear in $n$. We describe the application of our algorithm to the case of single topic modeling. We empirically show the effectiveness of our algorithm as compared to other sampling techniques. The obvious extensions of this work are i) to give tighter bounds for the sum of sensitivities and hence decrease the dependence of the sampling complexity on $n$ and ii) decrease the space usage. Our work is focused on supersymmetric tensors. Another obvious open question is to modify this algorithm for general tensors.
